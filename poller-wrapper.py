 poller-wrapper A small tool which wraps around the Observium poller
                and tries to guide the polling process with a more modern
                approach with a Queue and workers

 Author:        Job Snijders <job.snijders@atrato.com>
 Date:          Jan 2013

 Usage:         This program accepts one command line argument: the number of threads
                that should run simultaneously. If no argument is given it will assume
                a default of 16 threads.

                In /etc/cron.d/observium replace this (or the equivalent) poller entry:
                */5 *     * * *   root    /opt/observium/poller.php -h all >> /dev/null 2>&1
                with something like this:
                */5 * * * * root python /opt/observium/poller-wrapper.py 16 >> /dev/null 2>&1
